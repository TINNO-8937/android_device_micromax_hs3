         some range of adjustment to dim the screen further than usual in very
         dark rooms. The contents of the screen must still be clearly visible

         earlier.  A low value allows more memory to be used by processes but may cause more
         allocations to block waiting on disk I/O or lowmemorykiller.  Overrides the default
